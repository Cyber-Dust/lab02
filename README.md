* This was an amazing exercise in the use of `if`, and `else if` functions for me. Keeping track of the logic i was trying achieve between prompts, alerts, and questions was challegning and fun. There are a few improvments and design changes I would like make to the page in the coming days, so I'm excited to learn more and polish this page even further.
